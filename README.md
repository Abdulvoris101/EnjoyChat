# EnjoyChat
`Enjoychat` - a new social media created in the django framework for people to communicate with each other and have fun by posting

Enjoychat is a multi-tech project and this is my first social media project and I used a lot of technologies in this project, for example:

1. Django
2. Vue js cdn
3. Mysql
4. Bootsrap
5. Redis Cache
6. Websocket
7. Django channels

Unfortunately, there is no demo version of this project because I could not find anyone who would support me financially, because redis and many technologies are used here, and free servers do not support them.
